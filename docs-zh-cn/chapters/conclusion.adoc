## 终

You made it ! Or you jumped to this section. Anyway, congratulations. We hope you enjoy this lab and learn some
_stuff_. There is many other things Vert.x can do and that was not illustrated here.

Don't forget that reactive systems and so Vert.x requires a mind-shift:

* Vert.x is a toolkit
* Asynchronous, non-blocking development model can be hard to understand at the first glance, but it becomes very
convenient very quickly. Don't also forget, computers are asynchronous, so using such development model is
using it the right way to use it to its whole power.

If you want, and I hope so, to go further here are some references:
