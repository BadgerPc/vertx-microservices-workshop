## Preface

Let's start from the beginning.... _Vert.x_. What's Vert.x ? That's a pretty good question. If you go on the
http://vertx.io[Vert.x web site], Vert.x is defined as "a toolkit for building reactive applications on the JVM". This
description is rather fuzzy no ? What's a toolkit ? What are reactive applications ? In this lab, we are going to
explain these terms, and build an application using Vert.x. This application is going to be composed by
_microservices_. Another buzzword to be trendy? No, Vert.x was promoting _microservices_  before everyone and
 his dog jumped on the bandwagon. The application is going to be:

* based on vert.x (that's why you are here, no ?)
* distributed
* reactive
* (a bit) fun

This lab offers attendees an intro-level, hands-on session with Vert.x, from the first line of code, to making
services, to consuming them and finally to assembling everything in a consistent reactive system. It explains what
are reactive systems and what is reactive programming, how to build applications based on microservice**s** (the
**s** is important).

This is a BYOL (bring your own laptop) session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop. If you are using
Windows, we strongly recommend you to use a VirtualBox image we provide. You would also need Docker, not because Vert
.x needs Docker (it does not!), but to simulate a distributed system.

What you are going to learn:

* What is vert.x and how to use its asynchronous non-blocking development model
* How to develop microservices with Vert.x with several type of services, and service discovery
* What are and how to use `verticles`
* How to use the vert.x event bus to send and receive messages
* How to expose HTTP endpoint with Vert.x
* How to compose asynchronous actions
* How to use several languages in the same application
* How to use databases

And many other points too...
