## Preface

Let's start by the beginning.... Vert.x. What's Vert.x, that's a pretty good question. If you go on the
http://vertx.io[Vert.x web site], Vert.x is defined as "a tool-kit for building reactive applications on the JVM". This
description is rather fuzzy no ? What's a tool-kit ? What are reactive applications ? In this lab, we are going to
explain these terms, and build an application using Vert.x. This application is going to be composed by
_microservices_. A buzzword to be trendy? Actually no, Vert.x was promoting _microservices_  before everyone and his
dog jumped on the bandwagon. The application is going to be:

* based on vert.x (that's whyt you are here, no ?)
* distributed
* reactive
* (a bit) fun

This lab offers developers an intro-level, hands-on session with Vert.x, from the first line of code, to making
services, to consuming them and finally to assembling everything in a consistent reactive system. It explains what
are reactive systems and what is reactive programming, how to build applications based on microservice**s** (the
**s** is important).

This is a BYOL (bring your own laptop) session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop. If you are using
Windows, we strongly recommend you to use a VirtualBox image we provide.
