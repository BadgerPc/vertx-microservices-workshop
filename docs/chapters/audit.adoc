## The Audit service

The law is the law... The _Sarbanesâ€“Oxley Act_ requires you to keep a track of every transaction you do on a
 financial market. The audit service records the shares you buy and sell in a database. It's going to be a HSQL
 database, but is would be similar with another database, even no-sql database.

### Accessing data asynchronously

As said previously, Vert.x is asynchronous and you must never block the event loop. And you know what's definitely
blocking ? Database access and more particularly JDBC ! Fortunately, Vert.x provides a JDBC client that is asynchronous.

The principle is simple (and is applied to all client accessing blocking system):

[plantuml, database-sequence, png]
----
@startuml
autonumber
participant Application
participant Handler
participant Client
control Worker
database Database

Application -> Client : The application send the query, instruction,\n statement to the client; with a Handler
Client -> Worker : The client enqueue in a Worker the task to be done
Client -> Application : The client returns immediately
Worker -> Database : The worker executes the task on the database
Worker -> Client : When done, the worker notify the client
Client -> Handler : The client invokes the handler \n(in the same thread as the interaction (1))\n with the operation result.

However, interacting with database is rarely a single operation, but a composition of operation. For example:

1. Get a connection
2. Drop some tables
3. Create some tables
4. Close the connection

So, we need a way to composite these operations, and report failures when required. This is what we are going to see
in the Audit component.

### The Audit service

The Audit service:

1. Listens for the financial operation on the event bus
2. Stores the receive operation in a database
3. Exposes a REST API to get the last 10 operations

Interactions with the database use the `vertx-jdbc-client`, an async version of JDBC. So expect to see some SQL code
(I know you love it).

### Initializing the audit service with Composite Future

Open the `io.vertx.workshop.audit.impl.AuditVerticle` class. The first important detail of this verticle is its
`start` method. The method is asynchronous, and report its completion in the given `Future` object:

[source, java]
----
public void start(Future<Void> future) {
     // creates the jdbc client.
     jdbc = JDBCClient.createNonShared(vertx, config());

     // TODO
     // ----
     future.complete();
     // ----
}
----

Vert.x would consider the verticle deploy when the `Future` is valuated. It may also report a failure if the verticle
 cannot be started correctly.

Initializing the audit service includes:

* prepare the database (table)
* start the HTTP service and expose the REST API
* retrieve the message source on which the operation are sent

So, it's clearly 3 independent actions, but the audit service is started only when all of them has been completed.
Replace the `TODO` block by:

[source, java]
----
Future<HttpServer> httpEndpointReady = configureTheHTTPServer();
Future<MessageConsumer<JsonObject>> messageListenerReady = retrieveThePortfolioMessageSource();
Future<Void> databaseReady = initializeDatabase(config().getBoolean("drop", false));

CompositeFuture.all(httpEndpointReady, databaseReady, messageListenerReady)
    .setHandler(ar -> {
      if (ar.succeeded()) {
        // Register the handle called on messages
        messageListenerReady.result().handler(message -> storeInDatabase(message.body()));
        // Notify the completion
        future.complete();
      } else {
        future.fail(ar.cause());
      }
    });
----

First we create 3 `Futures`, one per action to execute. We are going to see how they are created in a minute. Then we
compose all of them using the `CompositeFuture.all` operator. When all the actions are completed, it calls the given
handler that registers the message listener storing the operation in the database.

To notify Vert.x that the start process is completed (or successfully or not), it calls `future.complete()` and
`future.fail`.

### Configure the HTTP server - async method pattern

We have mentioned that async method have a signature with a `Handler` as last parameter. There is an equivalent syntax
that returns a `Future` object when the operations they are executing are completed:

[source, java]
----
void asyncMethod(a, b, Handler<R> handler);
// is equivalent to
Future<R> asyncMethod(a, b);
----

Indeed, the caller can attach a `Handler` on the returned `Future` object to be notified when the operaiton has
completed:

[source, java]
----
Future<R> future = asyncMethod(a, b);
future.setHandler(ar -> {
  if (ar.failed()) { /* the operaiton has failed */ }
  else {
    // Do something with the result
  }
});
----

Let's implement the `configureTheHTTPServer` method following this pattern:

[source, java]
----
private Future<HttpServer> configureTheHTTPServer() {
    Future<HttpServer> future = Future.future();

    // Use a Vert.x Web router for this REST API.
    Router router = Router.router(vertx);
    router.get("/").handler(this::retrieveOperations);

    vertx.createHttpServer()
        .requestHandler(router::accept)
        .listen(8080, future.completer());

    return future;
}
----

It creates a `Router`. The `Router` is an object from http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/[vert.x web] that ease the
creation of REST API with vert.x. We won't go into too much details here, but if you want to implement REST API with
vert.x, this is the way to go. On our `Router` we declare a _route_: when a request arrive on `/` call this method.
Then, we create the HTTP server. The `requestHandler` is a specific method of the `router`, and in the `listen`
handler we pass `future.completer()`. This `completer` is roughly:

[source, java]
----
if (ar.failed()) { future.fail(ar.cause()); }
else { future.complete(ar.result()); }
----

So, the caller can call this method and get a `Future`. It can register a `Handler` on it that is called when the
`Future` receives a value (or a failure).

If you look at the `retrieveThePortfolioMessageSource`, you would see the very same pattern.


### Initializing the database with sequential composition

In the `start` method, we are calling `initializeDatabase`. Let's look at this method using another type of action
composition. This method:

* get a connection to the database
* drop the table
* create the table
* close the connection

All these operations may fail.

In the method code you see for each "step" a pair (`future`, `handler`):

[source, java]
----
// When the connection is retrieve, we want to drop the table (if drop is set to true)
// First, create a future notifying of the completion of the operation
Future<SQLConnection> tableDropped = Future.future();
// Then, define a handler doing this operation.
Handler<SQLConnection> dropTableHandler = (connection) -> {
  if (!drop) {
    tableDropped.complete(connection); // Immediate completion.
  } else {
    connection.execute(DROP_STATEMENT, completer(tableDropped, connection));
  }
};
----

The `Future` is used in the `Handler` to notify of the completion of the operation.

Once you have all the steps implemented like that, we can build a _sequential_ composition, i.e. A calls B when it's
 done, B calls C when it's done. This is achieved with the `compose` method of `Future`:

[source, code]
----
Future connectionRetrieved = ...
Future tableDropped = ...
Future tableCreated = ...
// ...
// connectionRetrieved -> dropTable
connectionRetrieved.compose(dropTableHandler, databaseReady);
// dropTable -> createTable
tableDropped.compose(createTableHandler, databaseReady);
// createTable -> closeConnection
tableCreated.compose(closeConnectionHandler, databaseReady);
----

The `compose` method executes the given `Handler` (first parameter) when the `future` is completed successfully. If
the `future` is a failure, it reports the failure on the second parameter (another `future` object).

### Retrieve results from the database with callback-based composition

You may ask why we do such kind of composition. Let's implement a method without any composition operator (just using
 callbacks). The `retrieveOperations` method is called when a HTTP request arrives and should return a JSON object
 containing the last 10 operations. So, in other words:

1. Get a connection to the database
2. Query the database
3. Iterate over the result to get the list
4. Write the list in the HTTP response
5. Close the database

The step (1) and (2) are asynchronous. (5) is asynchronous too, but we don't have to wait for the completion. In this
 code, don't use composition (that's the purpose of this exercise). In `retrieveOperations`, write:

[source, java]
----
// 1 - we retrieve the connection
jdbc.getConnection(ar -> {
  SQLConnection connection = ar.result();
  if (ar.failed()) {
    context.fail(ar.cause());
  } else {
    // 2. we execute the query
    connection.query(SELECT_STATEMENT, result -> {
      ResultSet set = result.result();

      // 3. Build the list of operations
      List<JsonObject> operations = set.getRows().stream()
          .map(json -> new JsonObject(json.getString("OPERATION")))
          .collect(Collectors.toList());

      // 4. Send the list to the response
      context.response().setStatusCode(200).end(Json.encodePrettily(operations));

      // 5. Close the connection
      connection.close();
    });
  }
});
----

So obviously it's possible. But imagine when you have several asynchronous operation to chain, it become a callback
hell very quickly. So, as a recommendation: use the vert.x composition operator.


### Show time !

Let's see how this works.

First you need to built it:

[source]
----
cd audit-service
mvn clean package docker:build
----

Then you need to launch the container:

[source]
----
docker run -p 8082:8080 --rm --name audit vertx-microservice-workshop/audit-service
----

You need to restart the dashboard to get access to the REST endpoint we just published:

[source]
----
docker stop dashboard
docker run -p 8083:8080 --rm --name dashboard --link audit:AUDIT vertx-microservice-workshop/trader-dashboard
----

Refresh the dashboard, and you should see the operations in the top right corner!
